    "    - I used a **purple-orange color gradient** for the arcs, where brighter colors represent more frequent trips between two stations. The thickness of the arcs was also adjusted to emphasize heavily trafficked routes.\n",

    "### Observations from the Map:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Midtown Manhattan**: As expected, the most frequent trips occur around **Midtown Manhattan**, especially near **Central Park**. This makes sense because it’s one of the busiest areas in the city, with a high concentration of both tourists and locals using bike-sharing services.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Busy Areas Around Universities**: You can also see some prominent routes around **Columbia University** and **New York University (NYU)**. These areas have a high density of students and staff, who may be using bikes for shorter commutes around campus or to nearby subway stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Else Stands Out:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tourist Areas**: Some of the busiest routes seem to be near **Times Square** and **Lower Manhattan**, near landmarks like the **World Trade Center** and **Battery Park**, indicating heavy bike traffic in these areas.\n",
    "- **Lesser Activity in Uptown**: Uptown Manhattan, especially north of Central Park, has relatively fewer trips, which suggests that the bike-sharing program sees less use in those residential areas compared to the business-heavy Midtown and Lower Manhattan areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why These Patterns Make Sense:\n",
    "\n",
    "**High Tourist Traffic**: Central Park, Times Square, and Lower Manhattan are some of the most visited spots in New York City, with tourists frequently opting to use bikes to travel between these locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The filter you applied helps highlight the areas of New York City with the most bike-sharing activity. These patterns suggest that bike-sharing is most popular in tourist hotspots and areas with high pedestrian traffic, like Midtown and the bridges connecting boroughs. A deeper analysis might reveal even more about the time of day or specific trip patterns, further enhancing the understanding of how bike trips are distributed across the city."
